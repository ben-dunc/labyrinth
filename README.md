# The Maze Game

This is a game that I made in high school starting in 2016 and finishing in spring 2017. During this time, I was taking AP Computer Science, learning Java. It was a fun exercise for me at the time and still is. I've continued to work on the project off and on, intending to add animated sprites. 

### To run the game
In the project directory, run the following:

```shell
javac *.java
java mazeApp.java
```
